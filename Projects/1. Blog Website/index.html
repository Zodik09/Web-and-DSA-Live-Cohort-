            <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
            <p>
                This is my first Blog Post for Live Cohort Assignment by Sheryians Coding
                School. In this Assignment I will be discusing about my favourite Anime -
                <b>Naruto</b><sup>(üí•Spoiler Alertüí•)</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Hidden Leaf Village, a powerful Nine-Tailed Fox (Kurama) attacked,
                causing massive destruction. To protect the village, the Fourth Hokage,
                Minato Namikaze, and his wife, Kushina Uzumaki, sacrificed their lives to
                seal the beast inside their newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki.
                <br />
                Orphaned and shunned by the villagers, Naruto grew up lonely but
                determined to earn their respect. Dreaming of becoming the Hokage, he
                trains as a ninja, forming bonds with teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura
                Haruno, under the guidance of their mentor, Kakashi Hatake.
                <br />
                As Naruto embarks on his journey, he faces powerful enemies, uncovers
                secrets about his past, and learns the true meaning of friendship,
                perseverance, and destiny. üåüüî•
